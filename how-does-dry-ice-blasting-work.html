Similar in concept to pressure washing, dry ice blasting uses compressed air to project media toward a surface at a high velocity. In this case, the media are carbon dioxide particles, which form solid pellets when cooled to -109.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Three immediate results can be obtained by blasting frozen carbon dioxide on a surface:</p><ul><li>The surface's contents freeze and fracture due to thermal shock before the pellets even make contact.</li><li>High-speed collisions between pellets and brittle contaminants break down unwanted residue into smaller pieces.</li><li>Exposure to room temperature air causes the dry ice to rapidly vaporize, resulting in an explosive effect that dislodges more debris.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://callawayindustrial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dry-ice-blasting-services.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dry Ice Blasting Services" data-cke-saved-src=" https://callawayindustrial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dry-ice-blasting-services.jpg"></p><h2>How to Use Abrasive Blazing</h2><ul><li>Abrasive blasting offers flexibility because of the variety of media available. The media chosen can be customized to fit the surface material and the contaminant being removed. When the surrounding surface is free from electrical and mechanical components, such as concrete silos, brick walls, or other steel structures, abrasive blasting can be used. The surface can also be profiled to allow for future applications or to shape the surface. Abrasive blasting requires cleanup of media and will not work in indoor areas that can't handle dust and excess mess.</li></ul><ul><li>Abrasive blasting offers flexibility because of the variety of media available. You can customize the media to match the material or the removal of the contaminant.</li><li>Abrasive blasting is ideal when the surface and surrounding area has no electrical or mechanical parts that could be damaged through the media being used, such as a sturdy brick wall, a concrete silo, or steel equipment.</li><li>This method is also used when the surface needs to be profiled for another application or shaping of the surface needs to happen.</li><li>Abrasive blasting will require cleanup and removal of the media, so for indoor spaces that cannot handle excessive mess and dust, abrasive blasting may not be ideal.</li></ul><h2>What is Dry Ice used in Cleaning?</h2><p>Dry ice blasting and cleaning uses compressed air to push CO2 pellets from a tube using a narrow tip that is aimed at the surface. Although it looks much like pressure washing or sand blasting, the big difference is that dry ice is - dry. Because the CO2 is cold (109 degrees below zero), dirt molecules shrink and are released from the surface. The ice pellets become gas when they hit the surface. This creates a molecular blast that removes dirt, grease, and paint from the surface without significantly cooling it.</p><ul><li>The only thing left to do is sweep up the residue of paint, ink, resins, asphalt, grime, adhesives or whatever has been removed from surfaces. No waste water. No chemical drainage. No sand or plastic beads scattered around. The CO2 solid pellets dissipate into the air and are absorbed by the atmosphere.</li><li>There is no dust or detritus from dry ice blasting that can be trapped in or foul up either the machinery being cleaned or nearby equipment.</li><li>The pellets are non-toxic; pose no workplace hazard to people or equipment, and meet EPA, USDA and FDA guidelines.</li></ul><p>With Ice Cleaning, you no longer have to take apart industrial equipment, move it to a cleaning area, and then move it back to the manufacturing floor to be reassembled. This allows you to clean it in situ, which greatly reduces downtime. The dry ice blasting nozzle is agile for reaching most exposed areas. You can clean the entire thing by doing some in-place disassembly if necessary.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 27, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/authors/cleaner/" rel="author">Cleaner</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/industries-and-applications-of-dry-ice-blasting.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Industries and Applications of Dry Ice Blasting</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:26" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/industries-and-applications-of-dry-ice-blasting.html">Industries and Applications of Dry Ice Blasting</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:26" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/dry-ice-blasting-compared-to-other-methods.html">Dry Ice Blasting Compared To Other Methods</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:25" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/dry-ice-cleaning-and-blasting-in-industrial-applications-services.html">Dry Ice Cleaning And Blasting In Industrial Applications Services</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Dry Ice Blasting Services</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DryIceBlastingServices/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
