NFPA 654 is the standard for the prevention of fire and dust explosions from the manufacturing, processing, and handling of combustible particulate solids and all other applicable regulatory requirements and standards.</p><h2>How Does Dry Ice Blasting Work?</h2><p>Dry ice blasting is a non-destructive cleaning process that uses solid carbon dioxide to dislodge residue while leaving the surface intact. Dry ice blasting is similar to pressure washing. It uses compressed air to propel media at high speed towards a surface. In this case, the media are carbon dioxide particles, which form solid pellets when cooled to -109.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Blasting frozen carbon dioxide onto a surface has three immediate effects:</p><ul><li>The surface's contents freeze and fracture due to thermal shock before the pellets even make contact.</li><li>The high-speed collision between the pellets and the brittle surface contaminants breaks unwanted residue into small pieces.</li><li>The dry ice quickly vaporizes when exposed to ambient air at room temperature. This results in more debris being released.</li></ul><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://334646-1028689-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CO2-Blasting-Blade-Attachment-Grooves-Turbine-Rotor.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dry Ice Blasting Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Here are a few of the benefits to dry ice blasting:</h2><ul><li>Companies won't experience much downtime due to the fact that machines don't need disassembly or reassembly.</li><li>A quicker clean, that's non-abrasive, non-conductive, non-flammable.</li><li>There is no secondary waste or cleanup, which saves money on labor and expenses.</li><li>Our blasting nozzles allow us to get into tight spaces - this can be a problem for companies that use other cleaning methods.</li><li>Environment-friendly - Meets the requirements of USDA, FDA, and EPA.</li><li>Employees are safe - there is no need to expose them to chemicals and grit media</li></ul><p>* Please have your EHS manager contact us if you are in a flammable environment so we can procure a safe workplace*</p><h2>Our Technology</h2><p>Dry ice cleaning is non-abrasive, non-conductive, non-toxic, and non-flammable.

You can choose the media that best suits the surface and remove the contaminants. When the surrounding surface is free from electrical and mechanical components, such as concrete silos, brick walls, or other steel structures, abrasive blasting can be used. This method is also used when the surface needs to be profiled for another application or shaping of the surface needs to happen. Abrasive blasting requires cleanup of media and will not work in indoor areas that can't handle dust and excess mess.</li></ul><ul><li>Because of the wide range of media options, abrasive blasting allows for flexibility. The media chosen can be customized to fit the surface material and the contaminant being removed.</li><li>When the surrounding surface is free from electrical and mechanical components that might be damaged by the media used (e.g. a brick wall or concrete silo), abrasive blasting can work well.</li><li>When the surface is to be profiled or shaped for another purpose, this method can also be used.</li><li>Abrasive blasting requires cleanup of media. If indoor space is not able to handle the mess, then abrasive blasting might not work.</li></ul><h2>More About Dry Ice Blasting</h2><p>The three ways in which dry ice blasting works on your surface cleaning project:</p><ul><li>Thermal effect cleaning action. As the dry ice strikes the substrate surface, the temperature of both the dirt/residue layer and the substrate decreases. The freezing cold ice hitting the surface lowers the temperatures of different materials in unequal ways, for instance food residue freezes faster than the stainless steel surface underneath, and this effect causes the food to shrink and releases surface adhesion or surface tension, allowing the impact to remove the debris. This thermal effect helps to separate the dirt/residue from the substrate.</li><li>Sublimation refers to the process where dry ice is converted almost immediately back into gas. The ice-to-gas conversion occurs when the solid ice hits the surface. This releases the entire energy used to make the gas solid. It also creates an explosive reaction that multiplies the cleaning force, trapping dirt and increasing its potency.</li></ul><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://polarclean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mechanical-Dry-Ice-Blasting-Indianapolis-IN-5.1-After.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dry Ice Blasting Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Information</h2><p>TuneRS Motorsports' award-winning CryoDetail(r) division is the first and original dry ice blasting facility in North America for automotive restoration and preservation.

It looks similar to sandblasting or pressure washing, but the main difference is dry ice. The CO2 is so cold - 109deg below zero - that it causes the dirt molecules to shrink, loosening them from the surface. As soon as the ice pellets hit the surface they change from solid to gas, creating a molecular "blast" that pries off dirt, grime and paint without significantly lowering the temperature of the surface.</p><ul><li>Only thing you need to do now is clean up any paint, glue, resins, asphalt or grime that has been left behind. There is no waste water. No chemical drainage. No sand or plastic beads scattered around. The CO2 solid pellets dissipate into the air and are absorbed by the atmosphere.</li><li>There is no dust or detritus from dry ice blasting that can be trapped in or foul up either the machinery being cleaned or nearby equipment.</li><li>They are safe for the workplace and do not pose a danger to equipment or people.</li></ul><p>Ice Cleaning eliminates the need to disassemble industrial equipment and move it to an area for cleaning. Then, it can be returned to its original location to be reassembled. This allows you to clean it in situ, which greatly reduces downtime. Dry ice blasting is very agile and can reach most areas. You can clean the entire thing by doing some in-place disassembly if necessary.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://cisp.cachefly.net/assets/articles/images/resized/0000985848_resized_dryiceblasting2.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dry Ice Blasting Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Dry Ice Cleaning And Blasting In Industrial Applications</h2><p>Because you don’t need to wait for chemicals or water to dry, electrical parts and generators are immediately ready to go. Because radioactive residue is smaller than the waste water from pressure washing, dry ice blasting makes it easier to remove them. Applications around the globe are using dry ice for cleaning, including:</p><ul><li>Inside Heat Exchanger Tubes - Inside Diameter (ID)</li><li>Outside Fin Fans Cooler cleaning</li><li>Fire Restoration and Cleanup</li><li>Smoke Damage Restoration</li><li>Printing presses</li><li>Cleaning of manufacturing equipment</li><li>Piping Cleaning and Maintenance</li><li>Storage tanks</li><li>Reactor Cleaning</li><li>Shell and Tube Heating exchangers</li><li>Equipment for the oil field</li><li>Turbines, transformers</li><li>Sub-stations for power</li><li>Boilers</li><li>Molds and Presses</li><li>Electric Motors and Circuit Boards</li><li>Food Processing Equipment</li><li>Generators</li><li>Gears</li></ul><p>Industries and commercial companies are also using dry ice blasting to complete periodic maintenance cleaning projects, because of the ability to avoid or isolate downtime. This method is increasingly being employed in the food sector for the safe cleaning of packaging lines and ovens.</p><p>The replacement of solvents, which can cause damage to the environment or pose a danger in workplaces (e.g. acids and caustics), has been dry ice. This also eliminates the very expensive hazardous waste disposal costs to get rid of both the chemical drainage and the residue which has been contaminated by the chemicals.</p><h2>Benefits of Dry Ice Cleaning Services with Co2</h2><p>Dry ice blasting is a popular choice for industrial plants who are looking for effective equipment cleaning techniques.</p><p>Environmentally Friendly</p><p>The CO2 pellets penetrate the contaminant layer and upon impact, sublimate to a gas and thereby generate no secondary waste. The CO2 liquid used to generate the pellets is originally captured as a waste product and recycled, allowing EAI to create dry ice pellets.</p><p>Non-Destructive</p><p>The CO2 pellets are abrasive but will not damage the surface being cleaned.</p><p>Highly Effective</p><p>Because dry ice blasting has a unique expansion and flushing effect, it cleans more effectively because dried ice pellets shrink 700x when they are applied to the cleaning nozzle.</p><p>Flexible Availability</p><p>As a dry, efficient process, CO2 blasting is safe for a variety of industrial environments, including operations around electrical equipment.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://334646-1028689-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CO2-Blasting-Blade-Attachment-Grooves-Turbine-Rotor.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dry Ice Blasting Services" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Comparison of Dry Ice Blasting to Other Methods</h2><p>There are many available methods for cleaning industrial equipment. Each method has advantages and drawbacks, and some are comparable to dry ice blasting in some areas while falling short in others. This is how other cleaning methods stack up against dry ice blasting:</p><ul><li>Abrasive blasting. Unlike dry ice blasting, abrasive blasting is highly toxic and dangerous for the operator. To avoid being exposed to fumes or dust, the operator should wear a mask and a breathing device.</li><li>Soda blasting. Abrasive blasting can be used in a variety of ways, including soda blasting.</li><li>You can pressure wash. Pressure washing, like dry ice blasting is not abrasive. It does not cause any harm to the environment by emitting or toxic chemicals. This method, however, is not electrically conductive and requires wastewater disposal.</li><li>Tools for hand. Hand tools are environmentally safe, don't use toxic materials, require no special waste considerations, and are not electrically conductive. Hand tools have a lot of disadvantages, including abrasiveness and additional labor requirements.</li></ul><p>There are a variety of safety benefits included with dry ice blasting which might not be found using other industrial cleaning methods. The most prominent of these include:</p><ul><li>Elimination of toxic chemicals and emissions</li><li>Reduced waste of cleaning solutions</li><li>Surface degradation by abrasives prevented</li></ul><h2>Industries And Applications Of Dry Ice Blasting</h2><p>Dry ice blasting is an effective solution for removing unwanted contaminants and residues from the production process, such as:</p><ul><li>Oils</li><li>Adhesives</li><li>Resins</li><li>Paints</li><li>Greases</li><li>Asphalt tars</li><li>Biofilms</li><li>Aerospace. The aerospace sector relies on dry ice blasting to remove mastic from parts; clean turbine blades; remove labels from fuselage; and clean hydraulics, electrical components and circuitry, and landing gear.</li><li>Automotive. Dry ice blasting is ideal for cleaning engine blocks and components, undercarriages, wheels and axles, automotive production equipment, and more.</li><li>Power plants and electrical equipment. Dry ice blasting is often used to remove oil residue and/or corrosion from power generation equipment, such as turbines and generators.
